# Credit_Potential_Customers_Bank
The idea of the project was to prepare a report for the loan division of a fictional bank. I had to test whether a client's marital status and number of children have an impact on loan default.
The report was considered when creating a credit score for a potential customer. A credit score is used to assess a potential borrower's ability to repay their loan.

## Data Description

children: the number of children in the family
days_employed: how long the client has been employed
dob_years: the client's age
education: the client's education level
education_id: identifier for the client's education
family_status: the client's marital status
family_status_id: identifier for the client's marital status
gender: the client's gender
income_type: the client's income type
debt: whether the client has already defaulted on a loan
total_income: monthly income
purpose: reason for taking a loan

### Columns created through analysis:

family_category: family category (children + family_status)
credit_potential: credit potential
